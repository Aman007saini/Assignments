    "- **PMF** is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability that a variable is exactly equal to some value. Example: The probability of getting 2 heads in 3 coin tosses.\n",
    "- **PDF** is used for continuous random variables and describes the relative likelihood for a variable to take on a given value. Example: The height distribution of people in a population."

    "The **Cumulative Density Function (CDF)** gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. Example: For a normal distribution, the CDF at x=1 gives the probability that a value is less than or equal to 1. CDF is used to determine probabilities for ranges and to compare distributions."
