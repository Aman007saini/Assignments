    "\n",
    "**GET** and **POST** are two of the most commonly used HTTP methods:\n",
    "- **GET:** Used to request data from a specified resource. Data is sent in the URL, making it visible and limited in length. It is mainly used for retrieving data.\n",
    "- **POST:** Used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. Data is sent in the request body, making it more secure for sensitive information. It is mainly used for submitting form data or uploading files."
