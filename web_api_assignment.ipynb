    "\n",
    "## Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.  \n",
    "**Example:** When you use a weather app on your phone, it uses an API to fetch weather data from a remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Enables communication between different software systems.\n",
    "- Promotes code reusability and modularity.\n",
    "- Simplifies integration with third-party services.\n",
    "- Enhances security by exposing only necessary data/functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- Can introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly managed.\n",
    "- Versioning and backward compatibility can be challenging.\n",
    "- Dependency on external APIs may lead to issues if the API changes or is unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web API** is an API that can be accessed over the web using HTTP/HTTPS protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference:**\n",
    "- **API:** General term for any interface that allows communication between software components.\n",
    "- **Web API:** A specific type of API accessible via web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS).\n",

    "## Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST (Representational State Transfer):**\n",
    "- Architectural style for designing networked applications.\n",
    "- Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
    "- Stateless and supports multiple data formats (JSON, XML).\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):**\n",
    "- Protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.\n",
    "- Uses XML for message format.\n",
    "- Requires strict standards and is more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shortcomings of SOAP:**\n",
    "- More complex and heavyweight compared to REST.\n",
    "- Slower due to XML parsing.\n",
    "- Less flexible with data formats.\n",
